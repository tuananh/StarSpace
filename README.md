## Requirements

- Boost is required according to StarSpace (Should I include boost in this project and let CI (travis) build binaries !?)

- if you wish to run the unit tests in src directory, <a href=https://github.com/google/googletest>google test</a> is required and its path needs to be specified in 'TEST_INCLUDES' in the makefile.
